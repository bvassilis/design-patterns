Adapter
-------
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
/ Adapter lets classes work together, 
that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.


Bridge
------
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
/ Composite lets clients treat individual objects and 
compositions of objects uniformly.


Composite
---------
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
/ Composite lets clients treat individual objects and 
compositions of objects uniformly.


Decorator
---------
add additional responsibilities dynamically to an object.


Flyweight
---------
use sharing to support a large number of objects 
that have part of their internal state in common 
where the other part of state can vary.


Memento
-------
capture the internal state of an object without violating encapsulation and 
thus providing a mean for restoring the object into initial state when needed.


Proxy
-----
provide a “Placeholder” for an object to control references to it.
